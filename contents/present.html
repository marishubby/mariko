    Hi! Currently I'm writing this letter (Mari), we are in a call and I was sad today but when I called you...your voice cheered me up. I love you so much and I dont know how to appreciate you enough. You always put a smile on my face no matter what. I always want to keep you around, I hope when this letter reaches you we are still together, closer, smarter and way more in love with each other. And if we aren't (god forbid) text me. No matter what happened or something just text me and remind me that today 1.14.2022 I love you and I swore that Id love you forever. You got finals soon and we arent able to see each other, but hey....maybe you guys see each other even more now. I hope you do, because I miss my baby and I miss his hugs <3 his warm body and his nice lips. I love you! and Im sure Ill love you even more years later. I hope you know that I have a soft spot for you in my heart and no matter what happens I will always love you. Im not sure if ill ever be able to love someone else as much as I love you now. I feel like we dont talk much anymore but im sure in february we will talk more and i will get to appreciate your presence even more. I have some questions for you guys. 1.from 1 to 10 how did you change? 2.saba, do u still love me the same? 3.did u get a room? xddd 4.are we closer than we are now? 5.mari, do u still dream abt being his wife? 6.did you hear each others peeing?

    Hi, now it's my turn to write a letter (saba). Past few days, or maybe more than few have been stressing because of the exams and stuff and I feel like i dont pay enough attention to my baby. Future me, I hope you are doing way better than I do, I hope that you appreciate her more than now and I am sure you will be loving her more and more everyday. I am sure you both are still together, but I just want to tell you that whatever happens, never let her go, never make her feel hurt and protect her even if it means you will be hurt. Never ever let yourself make any mistake because she is the love of your life and you must always take care of her. She is my precious girl, she is my treasure and I'm sure she means even more for you. I want you to be always with her when she needs and always overcome any barriers and reach her. By the time you are reading this I want both of you to be in a call, reading this with teary eyes and telling each other how much more you love each other. And I am sure I can be proud of you two because together you can overcome anything. I love mari with my whole heart and I will never stop loving her, not in my life. And I am also sure that you will be closer and loving each other more. She is my girl and I want you to always be there for her. I want you to always love her unconditionally and protect her. She is my world, she is my everything. She is the woman I want to marry and she is the woman who will bear my children. Even now she is crying and don't you dare ever make her cry again. I did some things that were wrong but I tried my best to make her feel better again and I need you to never do wrong things again. I want you to love her more than I do and make her feel better and happy. If anything happens to her you will be responsible and I promise now that I will love her till I die.
    <br/>
    Take care of her and love her always!
